Title: `SPOTlight`: Spatial Transcriptomics Deconvolution
Description: `SPOTlight`provides a method to deconvolute spatial transcriptomics
    spots using a seeded NMF approach along with visualization tools to assess
    the results. Spatially resolved gene expression profiles are key to
    understand tissue organization and function. However, novel spatial 
    transcriptomics (ST) profiling techniques lack single-cell resolution and 
    require a combination with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 
    information to deconvolute the spatially indexed datasets. Leveraging the 
    strengths of both data types, we developed SPOTlight, a computational tool 
    that enables the integration of ST with scRNA-seq data to infer the location
    of cell types and states within a complex tissue. SPOTlight is centered 
    around a seeded non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) regression, 
    initialized using cell-type marker genes and non-negative least squares
    (NNLS) to subsequently deconvolute ST capture locations (spots).
